# Eat da Burger

Eat da Burger is a Full Stack app that puts together NODE, HTML, CSS, Express, and MYSQL.

I cover all parts of CRUD in this project as well as an iFrame to provide some entertainment.

## Using the App

To add something to the database, just type the name of a burger in the Type a burger input section and click 'Add Burger'.  Clicking the button will move this burger down to the Burgers list on the bottom left of the screen.

Once the burger has been "eaten" click on the ham-bugler to send the burger over the to 'BURP' section.

To Delete the burger from the database click on the toilet to "flush" it out.


I also thought it was a bit fitting to include the classic game Burger Time in this page.   To play the game, click the bottom Play Now Button.  This game is controlled by keyboard.  All you need to do is press enter to start the game on 1 player and user the arrow keys to navigate.  The goal of the game is to drop all of the parts to the burger all the way to the bottom of the page while avoiding the roaming onions, sausages and pickles.  You get extra points for trapping them in the burger.
